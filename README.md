# Rust Learning

I am starting learning a new programming language, which is Rust.

## Plan

Rust is a fully functioned programming language, I decided to start from its basic syntax and usage from the book *The Rust Programming Language*, which can be found [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book). Then move to some tasks like algorithms, computer vision, and machine learning.

* [ ] Tutorial from the book.
* [ ] A webserver (project from the book).
* [ ] Algorithms from selected LeetCode questions.
* [ ] Selected tasks on computer vision with OpenCV.
* [ ] Machine learning.
* [ ] Deep learning with Tensorflow.

## Progress

Record the correct progress here.

### Tutorials from the Book

* [x] Guessing Game from [Chapter 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).

## Environment

> This may be updated over time.

* Windows 10 1809
* Rust 1.31.1 (epoch 2018), MSVC toolchain
* Intellij IDEA 2018.3.2
